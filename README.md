# MAD-GAN
TensorFlow implementation of Multi-Agent Diverse Generative Adversarial Network (MAD-GAN) In three different datasets:
* A distribution of 1D GMM having five mixture components with modes at 10, 20, 60, 80 and 110, and standard
deviations of 3, 3, 2, 2 and 1, respectively.
* A distribution of 2D GMM having six mixture components with modes at circumference of a cricle with radius of 5
* MNIST dataset
